<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Connected and Automated Vehicle education (CAVe)-in-a-box is an educational tool developed under the FHWA Workforce Development (WFD) project. CAVe-in-a-box is an interconnected set of ITS equipment that was developed to serve as training and educational resources for the emerging ITS workforce. CAVe-in-a-box represents an ITS environment into a scaled-down portable kit. The kit can be installed at any location which can emulate an intesection where a traffic signals could be implemented, making it well-suited for application testing in the classroom for laboratory use, as well as real world deployment. The kit contains two major components as described below: a mobile kit, representing the vehicle, and an infrastructure kit, representing the environment of a CAV system:

|INFRASTRUCTURE KIT (Roadside Unit Kit) | MOBILE KIT (OnboardUnit Kit)|
|---------------------------------------| ---------------------------|
|RSU | OBU |
|Signal Controller | Controller Area Network(CAN Connector)|
|Wired Network Switchwith Power over Ethernet (PoE) | Wired Network Switch|
|Power Supply | Antenna Mount|
|Tablet PC (Windows/Linux) | Tablet PC (Windows/Linux)|
 |  | Car Power|

### Built With

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
* [sqlpad](https://sqlpad.github.io/sqlpad/#/)
* [J2735: Dedicated Short Range Communications](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j2735_200911/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started install the prerequisites and obtain a copy of J2735.py and place it inside kafka/src/dsrc_message_decoder.

### Prerequisites

cav in box uses docker container to start the services.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
```

`J2735.py` to obtaine the source code for J2735.py contact [CAVSupportServices@dot.gov](CAVSupportServices@dot.gov)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/cav-education.git
   cd cavinbox/docker
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To take a look at the UI open browser and use bellow to access the UI

| Feature         | address         |
| --------------  | --------------- |
| CAV LIVE UI     | localhost:5000  |
| Control Center  | localhost:8083  |
| Sqlpad          | localhost:3000  |

Sqlpad will require username and password. 

## Local Tests

to run local test cases use the test folder to produce sample data
```bash
cd cavinbox/test
python client.py
```
